Here is the source code for an application about fpegenaute Master Thesis for the MSc in Bioinformatics for Health Sciences using Python and Pyqt5 library.
The idea of his project (["Automated structural information retrieval for Integrative Modeling"](https://github.com/fpegenaute/TFM/blob/main/README.md#automated-structural-information-retrieval-for-integrative-modeling)) was to create a tool that combines information from already existing and experimental data in order to predict the dynamics of proteins.
Basically, we gather information from PDB (Protein Data Bank) and AlphaFold or RoseTTaFold and use it as an input for IMP ([Integrative Modeling Platform](https://integrativemodeling.org/)), which gives us an hybrid approach integrating data from diverse biochemical and biophysical experiments.
